# Union Find Explain visual

This repo implements and visualizes the Explain algorithm from <Proof-producing Congruence Closure> Nieuwenhuis, R., & Oliveras, A. (2005, April).  


## Notes on implementation

The implementation itself starts from  
the [hypergraph rewriting](https://met4citizen.github.io/Hypergraph/**
), which itself is using
[3d Force-Directed Graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph)
for representing graph structures,
[ThreeJS](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)/WebGL for 3D rendering and
[d3-force-3d](https://github.com/vasturiano/d3-force-3d) for the force engine.
